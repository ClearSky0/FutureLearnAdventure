# FutureLearnAdventure
A text based adventure based on and inspired by the Future Learn course 'Object-oriented Programming in Python."

Things I've added/changed:
    - pacification of the 'fight' method
    - a roaming character "The Rev"
    - random talk responses from "The Rev"
    - three attempts to please an enemy class
    - changed the backpack into an instance of an item class
    - the backpack is an item and can contain other items, freaky
    - what, who, look, inv, drop commands
    - "all" logic on take and drop commands
    - basic "verb & noun" two word input
    - plus other things I've forgotten.

The object of the game is to please the "enemies" so The Rev can get
back to wandering round and writing more songs.
